# image-to-ascii-svg
An image to ascii converter which outputs to SVG format for poster printing. Inspired by [CodingTrain's Coding Challenge #166](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/166-image-to-ascii) and [Karthik Iyer's similar implementation](https://github.com/KarthikRIyer/image2ascii) in Rust.

The script uses `pillow` to read images and increase their contrast, then extract the raw RGB data.
Then, luminance values are calculated for each pixel and linearly interpolated onto a "density string",
or a series of characters that appear decreasingly brighter.

The density string included in the project is: `"Ã‘@#W$9876543210?!abc;:+=-,.   "` which is a lightly modified version
of CodingTrain's density string.

## Run it yourself

This project was written for and tested with Python 3.12.

You can run this project by installing the dependencies with a Python virtual environment:
```shell
python3.12 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Place input PNG and/or JPG files into the `input/` directory.

Then, run the script:
```shell
python image2ascii.py
```

Your converted images will be saved to the `output/` directory. Existing files with the same name in `output/` will be overwritten.
